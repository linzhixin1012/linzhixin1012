## Zhixin's ðŸ‘‹

- Hi, Iâ€™m Zhixin. It's my pleasure to introduce myself to everyone who comes here.
- I was born in China and spent most of my life here, and also luckily have been to several places around the world for study such as NYC and London.
- My undergrad major is Statistics and currently I'm a master student at NUS. Really love my home country, and also, enjoy experiencing different cities not as a visitor but a part of them.
- Actually not sure what to post here, but will try to make it cool! :)
